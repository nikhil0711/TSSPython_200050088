    "\n",
    "Its never suggested to keep all your money invested, you must have some risk-free assets as well, so that even if you lose some of your cash in trading, you could still place better bets and regain that lost cash, Thus, We get our third Hyper-parameter: **R**, The Ratio of Total Balance, which we will using for investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not be investing in all the 30 Tickers now, Will you? You will choose the top few stocks, which show the highest promise in terms of Momentum, which brings us to another hyper-parameter: **M**, The Number of Top few stocks (based on Momentum), which you'll keep in your Portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, There's some brokerage fee which you need to pay in order to place orders on the stock market, typically its less than 0.05% of the total amount : **F**\n"

The Stock Market isn't open on all days, so we often won't be able to go N days behind, and will have to take the closest value instead(We can't just go N entries behind in the List we created and expect that to work, Why?) In order to work with dates, you should get to know more about the datetime library of Python from [here](https://thispointer.com/python-how-to-convert-datetime-object-to-string-using-datetime-strftime/) (Especially the datetime.strftime() function) and about the [datetime.timedelta()](https://www.studytonight.com/python-howtos/how-to-add-days-to-date-in-python) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you may have figured it out yourself, while DataFrames are great for Data Handling and small statistical calculations, They aren't so for big calculations as the Numpy Library has both a richer variety of functions for such manipulations and is also more efficient!\n",
    "\n",
    "After we calculate the Momentum for all our Tickers, it would be a great thing to do, if we could divide their prices by their mean(in the N day interval, as we need to see which stock outperforms others and in order to do this, it won't be fair if we take the absolute growth in numbers!(Why?)\n",
